Task 5 : Water -quality index and parameters identification

AIM : This task is to short list the water quality parameters and  identify the min ,Max and the need treatment values for each shortlisted parameters.

Execution : 1.Looked into various literature and short listed around 33 feasible parameters for determing the water quality and their suitable ranges.

            2.WQI formulae derived and following rating scale is proposed
            
Rating scale proposed was in the range of 0–100 and
grading were proposed as 

A for 0–25 (Excellent), 

B for 26–50 (Good), 

C for 51–75 (Poor),   

D for 76–100 (Very Poor)
